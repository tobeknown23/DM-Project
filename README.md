PROJECT PLATFORM: VISUAL STUDIO (.NET)

PROJECT LANGUAGE: C#

PROJECT CONCEPT AND DETAIL: The Project will include cryptography that is used to hide images and image is based on user input and is done by using RSA (RONALD RIVEST, ADI SHAMIR AND LEONARD ADLEMAN). When image is taken as input its properties will be displayed i.e. image size, file name and image resolution. After this Hex function will extracts image Hex code and then it is going to convert in cipher text through RSA Algorithm. When this cipher text will be loaded and applied RSA Algorithm, it will decipher the text, and the image is loaded back.
