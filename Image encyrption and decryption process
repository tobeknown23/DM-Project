Encryption of image by HEX function to extract HEX Code and using RSA public key algorithm. To get cipher image text. 
Decrypted cipher text to Hex code image by HEX function and using RSA private key Algorithm
Encryption Process:
RSA algorithm is usually used for text encryption. But for providing security on image transmission.RSA algorithm for Encryption and Decryption
1.   Choose two prime numbers p and q. Calculate the product of p and q.
2.   Calculate the value, n = p q. 
3.   Compute by Euler's totient function.
4.   Choose a number e such that , e and φ(n) are co-prime and e is the used as  public key.
5.   Determine d as d ≡ e −1 .       
     Obtain the encrypted image C .
7.   C = C mod 256, as  level values of image that lies in  range [0,255]. 
8.   Recover decrypted image.
9.   The original input (recovered) image.


 The encryption and decryption done by using library C#,  Images are encrypted, and create the text file, the same file is used for decryption.
 Library is used for basic conversion, processing Hex values, byte array to image conversion, image to byte array conversion.
 
 Decryption the cipher text image:
 Cipher string  converted into character array. 
 Each character de ciphers with RSA and the Decipher character  is converted into original value. Each character is pass, then the pass string is return
