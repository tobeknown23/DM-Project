 Start

 Choose two prime numbers

p = 3 and q = 11

 Compute the value for ‘n’

n = p * q = 3 * 11 = 33

 Compute the value for ? (n)

 (n) = (p - 1) * (q -1) = 2 * 10 = 20

 Choose e such that 1 < e <  (n) and e and n are coprime. Let e = 7

 Compute a value for d such that (d * e) %  (n) = 1. d = 3

Public key is (e, n) = (7, 33)

Private Key is (d, n) = (3, 33)

 Stop.

Let M, is plain text (message), M= 2.

Encryption of M is: C = Me % n.

Cipher text is, C = 27 % 33.

C = 29.

Decryption of C is: M = Cd % n.

Plain text (message), M= 293 % 33.

M= 2
